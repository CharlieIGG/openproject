# Installation support for the Enterprise Edition

If you want to work with the on premise OpenProject Enterprise Edition but do not have a Community version running, you can order **installation support** during the [booking process of your Enterprise Edition](../activate-enterprise-edition).

The cost for the installation support of a Community version is 150 â‚¬. In the price there is no migration included. If you need migration support, please [contact us](mailto:info@openproject.com) for a detailed quotation.
